# Shopping Calculator

## Project Overview

### Introduction

Welcome to the Shopping Calculator App! This project was developed as the final project for the JavaScript course at Coderhouse. The application is designed to simulate a shopping experience, allowing users to create purchase tickets with products, categories, prices, quantities, and discounts.

### Features

- **Real-time Cart Management:** Add products to the cart and view live updates on quantity, subtotals, savings from discounts, and the final total.
- **Discount Options:** Choose from four different types of discounts for added flexibility.
- **Order Management:** Generate tickets, save them in the local storage, and cancel orders with ease.
- **Ticket History:** The "Ticket History" section will soon display all generated tickets, along with dates and store names.

> Note: The History Section is currently under construction, and additional features may be added in future updates.
